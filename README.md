# Island-Generator
The primary goal of this project was to develop and implement a unique procedural terrain generation method known as the “Particle Roll Algorithm”. This algorithm was designed to simulate the gradual formation of landmasses, providing a dynamic visual representation of terrain development on a 2D grid.
